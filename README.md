# Multilingual-character-detection
This project detects Telugu characters from printed and handwritten text using classical image processingâ€”grayscale, noise filtering, thresholding, and contour analysis. A custom dataset enables rule-based Unicode mapping and template matching, aiding text digitization, OCR, and preservation of regional scripts.
